# pandemicshakespeare

This project takes comments from 2020-2021 and plots them in an interactive scatterplot using the [Scattertext tool](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext), showing the most common words in annotations of Shakespeare's play "A Winter's Tale" about class, gender, pandemics, race, religion, and sexuality relative to the rest of the corpus of annotations.
