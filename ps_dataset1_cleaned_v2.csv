These lines reminded me of a riddle you'd maybe see in some sort of fairytale - almost Rumplestiltskin-like in the way Time asks the audience to guess who they are before revealing themselves,"I, that please some, try all—both joy and terror

"The way time speaks of its power here reminded me of the way time has felt during COVID. Sometimes months at a time can feel like they fly by in days and other times, days feel like they drag on like months.

"This line specifically really brought images of the emotions of the pandemic to my mind. Oftentimes right now, life can feel like we're just sleeping through it.

"I'm really intrigued by Shakespeare's decision to simply tell the audience of Leontes' mourning and character growth rather than actually showing it to the audience onstage. I'm wondering if this was effective in gaining the audience's trust and ability to 'root' for Leontes as a character, especially given they certainly witnessed his character flaws in the first part of the play. And even more so, would this have worked if Leontes was a woman instead? Would the audience have been more or less forgiving of her?","I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
  As you had slept between. Leontes leaving,

"These lines really show the classism that was present in Shakespeare and at the time for the idea that the daughter of a king would still be seen as remarkable and far better than what should have come from a cottage simply due to her birth status and not how she was raised and with what resources she grew up with. To Shakespeare class is inherent, not a product of your surroundings. ","I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
  daughter of most rare note. The report of her is
[45]  extended more than can be thought to begin from
  such a cottage.",Act 4 Scene 2,Class
"These lines again represent deep, inherent classism present in the core of the play. Polixenes clearly assumes the shepherd will be simple and easy to fool simply due to the seemingly irrelevant fact that he is a shepherd and Polixenes is a king.","appearing what we are, have some question with
  the shepherd, from whose simplicity I think it not
  uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither.",Act 4 Scene 2,Class
"This whole scene, to me, represents exactly what powers time boasted of at the beginning of the play. It seems time in this scene dragged on and on; the action felt chaotic and incredibly detailed, unlike the beginning of the act where 16 years passed by with the blink of an eye.",it.,Act 4 Scene 4 Part 2,Class
"It seems Cleomenes is falling over to praise Leontes for all of the growth and change he has gone through in the past 16 years, all of his faults forgotten due to how much he's suffered in that time. I find this a bit skeptical - how much growing can one really do when one is surrounded by people who will only tell them exactly what they want to hear?","No fault could you make
  Which you have not redeemed—indeed, paid down
  More penitence than done trespass.",Act 5 Scene 1,Class
"This sentiment really struck me as similar to the modern ""not like other girls"" trope. Leontes isn't grieving because he caused the death of any woman, but due to the virtue and specialness of this woman specifically. His respect does not extend past that.","True, too true, my lord.
[15]  If one by one you wedded all the world,
  Or from the all that are took something good
  To make a perfect woman, she you killed
  Would be unparalleled.",Act 5 Scene 1,Gender
"I found this concept fairly disturbing - that if Leontes married again, Hermione would appear and 'incense' him to murder his new wife. For one, it shows Leontes still takes little responsibility for his own actions, but it also shows a complete lack of remorse for violence against women. It seems Leontes' growth only extends to the one woman he has martyred and deemed worthy of his respect: Hermione. Killing his new wife is apparently still a rational choice. ","She had, and would incense me
[75]  To murder her I married.",Act 5 Scene 1,Gender
"The presentation of Hermione as a statue really furthers the imagery of her as a martyr, representative of virtue. She has become this symbol of a perfect woman, rather than being allowed to be her own human being. She wasn't really allowed to be a complex character with her own interesting growth and flaws and journey. ",To see the statue of our queen.,Act 5 Scene 3,Gender
"The imagery of Hermione as a statue feels a bit almost on the nose in terms of the idea of objectification. Hermione has quite literally been turned into an object, frozen and stagnant for the sole purpose of allowing a man's character to develop. Hermione became a way to facilitate Leontes' journey, forced to remain and statue, rather than having her own journey and being allowed growth of her own. ","[She draws a curtain
to reveal Hermione (like a statue).]",Act 5 Scene 3,Gender
I found the ending of the play to be a bit disappointing. I feel like Leontes really never had to come to terms with his wrongdoing and instead was given back everything he had lost by the end of the play. Everyone suffered and endured violence at his own hand and yet he still celebrates at the end of the play.,POLIXENES   She embraces him.,Act 5 Scene 3,Class

"CONVERSATION LEADER POST: This passage intrigues me as Antigonus seems to be generalising and labelling all women as treacherous if one is suspected to be guilty.

"Leontes was happy to cause suffering in the lives of others--Polixenes, Camillus, Perdita, Hermione--but the second he had to see those consequences in his own life he changed his tune. Like so many people during this pandemic, Leontes ignored the pain he was causing others until it affected him. Because he only changed his perspective after he lost his son, and later Hermione, is his guilt genuine or purely self-centered? Does it even matter? After he is reunited with Perdita, Hermione, and his stand-in son, Florizell, can we expect Leontes to revert back to his old ways or is he forever changed?","Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves

This is so far one of the most biting statement by Leontes  where he calls his wife a whore and adds if she deserves an awful name just like a women who sleeps with a man before her marriage.

"Illness here refers to jealousy that has  not only inflicted  Leontes' state of mind but also hinges the sense of being of other characters as well.

"In this passage,these lines made me ponder over the fact that time and again Hermione affirms her love for Leontes but still he did not believe in her words and became suspicious of her fidelity towards him.This refers to the patriarchal mindset of man who question his wife's character despite of her genuine proof of faithfulness.

"If he would have been so much worried about Hermione's reputation, he wouldn't have cursed and slut-shamed her without being completely confident about her relationship with Polixenes. He would have interacted with her about it first, instead of labelling her as an adulteress. It is all about trust and loyalty in a relationship.

"Conversation  Leader Post : There is rampant misogyny throughout the play. The shocking crudeness of the words Leontes uses for his wife, with whom he mingled happily little while ago, underlines the idea how women are not humans but objects to be owned. She was not a free person, she was owned by Leontes and the fact that her apparent affair, meant a shift in ownership, a queen was equated to a 'wench' and a  'hobby-horse'. Infidelity and misogyny are not merely ruled by emotions, they signify power and control dynamics as well.  Quite surprisingly these structures of control still continue in exactly the same way. Centuries and generations apart, the pandemic of misogyny is far from a cure. I would like to discuss this as a group.","My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name

"The introduction of Time as a character divides the play into two distinct parts. I wanted to bring this up as a possible conversation topic because I myself am conflicted about how I feel about this large gap in time. On one hand, I can see how it makes the overall plot and structure of the play seem disjointed, and over-manipulated by the author. On the other hand, Shakespeare's decision to fast forward 16 years in time seems consistent with what we've read up to this point. It's not so different than how the play opens with ""9 months has passed since Polixenes came to visit"". In addition, the events that happen up to this point are not strictly organized in time either, the inner dialogue that Leontes has could have been happening over a few hours, or even days for all we know. The timeline aside, I really liked the introduction of time as a character.

"Leontes' ability to send Hermione to prison so easily reminds me of contemporary incarceration practices, especially in the United States. Leontes has the power to declare what is considered a ""crime"" and how Hermione should be punished for it. In this sense, incarceration is not a means to achieve justice or reconciliation, but an oppressive system that prioritizes convenience, dominance, and paranoid, hyper-masculine, punitive impulses. What would justice look like in this play? Is there any? How do intersections like class and gender affect who is punished and who is forgiven? I’d like my group to reflect on these questions in relation to our lives and the pandemic. ","The center is not big enough to bear

While it is true that Leontes has become mad with jealousy , but  he  had said that he would listen to the oracle whether it speaks in his favor or Hermoine's favor. (Act 2 Scene  1, line 220) The fact that he completely  rejects the oracle highlights the urgency, the passion he has for punishing Hermoine.

"Conversation Leader Post: Leontes in this monologue outlines the issue of adultery, cuckoldry and thus the omnipresent misogyny. Hermione's apparent infidelity is something more than a personal matter of a couple. Leontes attaches himself to the word ‘cuckold’ and its social aspects which (gathering from this play) is the worst of worst that could happen to a man. He describes the problem of adultery by wives like a Pandemic. The Elizabethan society very well viewed it as Plague – debilitating as a disease, incurable, humiliating, happens to everyone and lived in fear of it.

"Leontes is threatening Camillo as if he owns him. This can be seen even today where because of the class difference many influential people treat the poor as their slaves and instruct them to work according to their will. If they fail to do so, then they torture them. It is always the underprivileged who have to suffer the most in each and every situation. Even during the pandemic, we can see how the poor are dying due to starvation.

I think Paulina is the first person who has so out rightly pointed out Leontes's mistake. She seems like a strong character.,"From all dishonesty he can. In this,

"I think Paulina makes an excellent point here. She comments on how people support the ones in power even when they are wrong. This eventually turns futile for everyone involved.  Flattery I feel is an important part of  a power dynamic. I do not think it comes out of loyalty all the time, but rather from a sense of self preservation. Going by that i would like to think that Paulina is more loyal to Hermione than Antigonus is to him at this moment.","You that are thus so tender o’er his follies
  Will never do him good, not one of you.",Act 2 Scene 3,
"Leontes has repeatedly suggested fire as a punishment, first for Hermione and now for his daughter. I don't know if that was the intention but it reminds of the witch hunt and women being burnt at the stake. ",And see it instantly consumed with fire.,Act 2 Scene 3,
"Mamillius's death has the effect of a magic spell or rather curse being broken. Suddenly Leontes, who up to this point was even willing to defy the words of Apollo( which is a huge offence considering the Oracle of Delphi was revered in the ancient times), has come to the realization that he has created a blunder. On a rational side it could be argued that the prophecy did warn that failure in bringing back the lost child would leave him without an heir and Mamillius's death did make it true, so maybe somehwhere Leontes did fear the Gods and didn't believe himself to be superior to them. Much like how it is easy to defy authority until we face the repercussions. ","Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves

"I think this is the most absurd thing I have ever read. I did think something would happen to him, remembering how Paulina said ominously that he is lost or how Hermione told him in his dream that he won't see his wife again.

"I think Shakespeare has brilliantly used time to explain the 16 year gap. time here does not offer any insights or cryptic messages, it merely fills in the gap and informs us about the characters. It reminded me of how in many comedy movies nowadays an unknown narrator would open the scene, laying the background for the audience. While it is clear that Time has been inspired by the chorus from Greek tragedies, I find Time's presence to be more light and completely informative. ","[Enter Time, the Chorus.]",Act 4 Scene 1,None
"This seems like a repetition of Act I, scene ii when Polixenes had expressed the wish to return home. It was with Polixenes's request that the plot gained pace. I wonder whether a similar thing would happen now.","As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the

"This particular dialogue shows the psychotic nature of Leontes. He has lost all trust in the people around him. He is deeply jealous and on the verge of madness. His initial fear was of his wife being an infidel and now with Camillo gone with the enemy, his fears only seem to be approaching reality. These lines show the mental trauma that he is facing. This brings me to the question of the treatment of madmen and the way in which mental health was viewed during the times of Shakespeare. Do you think that we are where we should be in terms of redressal of the issue of mental health over the past centuries? Is there a shift in the way people treat those who have a mental illness or does it still remain an ‘unspeakable’ thing in our society? ","I have drunk, and seen the spider.

"For our group I want to discus this passage and try to see any similarities with today's concepts like media trial and cancel culture.  Leontes has already had the trial for Hermione in his head and has declared her guilty. Not once has he consulted with anyone, not even Polixenes and Hermione. Leontes without any clarification has sentenced Hermione to prison. I also think that we can relate this to the increase in domestic violence during the lock-down. By imprisoning Hermione, Leontes has taken away her right to freedom which is especially cruel considering that she is pregnant. I would like to see how others perceive this passage and if they can find any similarities in the pandemic living situation.","Away with her to prison.

I find a similarity here between the fate of Sita in Ramayana. She too had to go through a test to prove her fidelity.

"This came as a slight surprise to me. While it is true that Leontes has become mad with jealousy , but he had said that he would listen to the oracle whether it speaks in his favor or Hermoine's favor. (Act 2 Scene 1, line 220) The fact that he completely rejects the oracle highlights the urgency, the passion he has for punishing Hermoine. This level of rage emphasizes that she is reduced to being a second class citizen because of her gender, despite being a Queen.","There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle.

"It is one thing for a king to be furious  and threaten death, or other cruel punishments and another thing when these threats are gender targeted.

"For our group, I want to discuss not only this passage, but the idea that Leontes is infected with jealousy. In this passage, we see his paranoia grows even deeper, and now he claims there is a plot to kill him. There is this morbid imagery of someone being poisoned, just as his own thoughts poison his mind. I want to relate this to mental health during the pandemic, and delusions people have obtained about the virus. I think many people struggled with their mental health (depression, anxiety) especially during the lockdown, but there was also a rise in delusional thoughts (just how Leontes' thoughts) when regarding conspiracy theories about masks and the virus. There are people who refuse to wear masks and think the virus is fake. How can we connect Leontes to these people during the pandemic?","How blest am I

"Perdita makes a good analogy here for the equality of classes. If the mighty sun does not differentiate between the rich and poor in providing light then why should anyone else?  It is very intriguing to see that although throughout the Act 4 everyone recognizes Perdita's regal manner ill-fit for a shepherdess but she herself neither sees it nor is swayed by Florizells' compliments. With a powerful sun analogy, she stood for equality. However, it wouldn't have mattered much to the Elizabethans since these words came from a young, delicate damsel.","I was about to speak and tell him plainly

"In contemporary societies 'class' allows social mobility and can be decided by wealth. So if the clown and shepherd are made rich, they'd be upper class or 'gentlemen' . But here in Elizabethan time, the fact that the Clown and Shepherd are talking about being gentlemen now and for coming generations; must have functioned as a rather funny joke for the audience. I pity them if it is indeed  the case. Also, extrapolating a little from this, I am reminded of the  Caste system in India that is decided by birth without any scope of social mobility. People from lower castes could achieve wealth, respect and prominence but their social ranks would be seen the same. They'd face discrimination and segregation and mocking by the upper castes.","Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy

I cannot get enough of Paulina's musings. She has a limitless mind and here describes the imaginary situation of what she would have done. This is subtly to manipulate or rather convince Leontes. It is partly due to the fact that the situation is favorable to her now because of Leontes guilt and partly because of her own speech talents.,Were I the ghost that walked,Act 5 Scene 1,None
"How Leontes now answers to Paulina getting carried away as if it is really Hermoine speaking! It is satisfying to see his fall from arrogance and narcissism. However, Shakespeare here uses Paulina (shrew) to be cruel to Leontes so that he can in contrast seem pitiful and be redeemed.  Leontes is victimized to arouse our sympathy but in absence of Paulina, he though would have been miserable still, but  not enough to be worthy of redemption.","Stars, stars,

Yet is only spoken of! It could be because playwright wants to save audience's  astonishment for Hermione's resurrection scene. Though I wonder how could Shakespeare miss on the opportunity of producing lengthy sentimental monologues for Leontes in his reunion with his daughter.

In a broader sense, the play so far has been full of transformations. What are some of the transformations that occur in the play, and what role do they have in the story? One that comes to mind for me is the transformation of Leontes' personality in Act 1. He turned from a friendly person into someone so bitter and jealous, which set in motion the deaths of so many people he loved.

I think Shakespeare here uses Time more as a device than for its philosophical or cosmic significance. He presents Time onstage to lead the audience through a smooth sail in the 16 year gap. In the whole  soliloquy Time explicitly states its purposes of appearing and self-grandeur thereby reducing the mythical factor usually associated with time. It also states that it shall not make a prophecy and only worked to introduce  the audience to the action and setting.

"Is Polixenes somewhat supporting marrying his son to Perdita, who is at the time only seen as a mere shepherd's daughter? I find it slightly interesting that this can be an argument to marry them since it seems that royalty and the wealthy back then liked to keep the power/wealth within the family and therefore usually married cousins or even closer relatives. Even now, there always seems to be a bit of a social dynamic in which the rich marry the rich or even the same race marries the same race. After so much time, it has been relatively recent since interracial marriage has been accepted as normal, but there is still slight remnants of that standard from the past. Do you think that's what Polixenes was trying to argue or was he more judging Perdita on her noble-like looks and therefore was less opposed to her?","You see, sweet maid, we marry

"Generally in Greek mythology at least, the oracle's word is taken to heart and regarded religiously. By not believing it, Leontes proves himself a tyrant and shows that he believes he is not only above the law, but also above God perhaps? Seeing himself as above the law is also an interesting  take as if read in a modern context, like the clips we watched in class today, it demonstrates a clear abuse of power.

"It is surprising how, on one hand Leontes wanted Polixenes to stay and on contrary he is surprised even after asking Hermione himself to make a pitch to Polixenes.

"The choice of the word ""infect"" here brings into mind the plague and in todays context, the virus. ",Who does infect her?,Act 1 Scene 2,Pandemics
this brings into mind  the early days of the pandemic when people weren't well informed of the  virus and hence could not make  a proper diagnosis. It also makes me think of some of the covid patients who were asymptomatic and therefore did not know that they were infected.,"There is a sickness
  Which puts some of us in distemper, but
  I cannot name the disease, and it is caught
  Of you that yet are well.",Act 1 Scene 2,Pandemics
"Camillo, being a servant is forced to carry out Leonetes's murderous  orders even though he understands that this is incorrect. Leonetes is using his higher social order to force Camillo to commit  a murder.","I must be the poisoner
[425]  Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do ’t
  Is the obedience to a master, one
  Who in rebellion with himself will have
  All that are his so too.",Act 1 Scene 2,Class
"While Polixenes has reacted to these accusations by showing his disgust,  I find it uncanny that he didn't try to better explain the situation or to try and understand why such a suspicion would arise. Leonetes and Polixenes were childhood friends and the most plausible course of action would be to discuss things and solve the misunderstanding instead of packing his bags and running away.","O, then my best blood turn
  To an infected jelly, and my name
[505]  Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
  Turn then my freshest reputation to
  A savor that may strike the dullest nostril
  Where I arrive, and my approach be shunned,
  Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection
[510]  That e’er was heard or read.",Act 1 Scene 2,Sexuality
Why does Leontes change his mind so quickly? He went from doubting a sacred oracle to doing a complete 180.,I have too much believed mine own suspicion.,Act 3 Scene 2,None
"The deities play a heavy role in this play, involving themselves with making bad tidings for Leontes/everyone who helped him.","The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
  And frown upon ’s",Act 3 Scene 3,Religion
"If this is read with ""bug"" relating to a sickness/pandemic, this is another example of Leontes' jealousy being referred to as an illness that could ""infect""/kill the people around him as well as himself.",The bug which you would fright me with I seek.,Act 3 Scene 2,Pandemics
"Leontes' ""sickness"" of jealousy manifests as an actual illness in his child, and kills him.","The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
  Of the Queen’s speed, is gone.",Act 3 Scene 2,Pandemics
"Paulina seems to love the brash independence she had in her first scene, as well as the boldness with which she spoke to Leontes. She now apologizes for him and speaks in a submissive manner, thinking first of his feelings instead of what she believes he needs to hear. Her role becomes more traditionally feminine.","lo, fool again!—
  I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children.
[255]  I’ll not remember you of my own lord,
  Who is lost too",Act 3 Scene 2,Gender

"Antigonus is feeling deep remorse for the child, and wishes he had not sworn to Leontes that he would get rid of it. ","my heart bleeds, and most accurst am I
  To be by oath enjoined to this",Act 3 Scene 3,None
"Antigonus is describing his dream to the baby, saying Hermione appeared more sorrowful than any person he had ever seen.",I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,Act 3 Scene 3,None
"In Antigonus' dream, Hermione's sorrowful weeping makes her speaking difficult.","And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes

"Antigonus awakens and understands his dream was more than a meaningless ""toy,"" but that it was all real.","I did in time collect myself and thought
  This was so and no slumber",Act 3 Scene 3,None
"Does this have a double meaning? The thought of Hermione and Polixenes having an affair behind his back haunts Leontes in his dreams. At the same time, all of these actions have in fact been concocted by his own dreams. ",Your actions are my dreams.,Act 3 Scene 2,Class
"A reference to 3.3.36, when Hermione instructs Antigonus to simply weep and leave behind the baby.",Weep I cannot,Act 3 Scene 3,None
It is interesting that she uses infectious to describe the way in which she was kept from Mamillius because he became sick after she was sent to prison. This quote emphasizes the conversation around isolation from one another and sickness or infection. In a way this is similar to how people who have been isolated now must keep distant due to fear of infection yet being separated can diminish mental health.,I am barred like one infectious,Act 3 Scene 2,Pandemics
She is basically saying that her word stands for nothing now that her integrity is in question. The difference between how she defends herself and how Leontes accused her speaks to the logic and calm demeanor that women have shown in the play so far compared to the irrationality of the men.,"But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
  To say “Not guilty.",Act 3 Scene 2,Class
"The oracle is where I stop completely believing the tragedy aspect and buy into the comedy aspect. The magic involved is interesting and almost everything immediately believes it but when it says something that Leontes disagrees with he ignores it and pushes the trial through. In addition, the rapid decline of the people around Leontes is a little unbelievable as well. ",Now blessèd be the great Apollo!,Act 3 Scene 2,Class
"Hermione has been placed entirely on the defensive - Leontes, as her accuser, needn't show any evidence to support his baseless accusations, and yet Hermione is required to show more proof of her innocence than simply her word","You knew of his departure, as you know
  What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence",Act 3 Scene 2,Gender
"This reminds me of Desdemona's defense of herself in Othello - Hermione is essentially saying that Leontes' distrust of her is the greatest punishment she could ever be given, and she does not think she will ever be in his favor again. Why is it such a common theme in Shakespeare's works that a woman's fall from her husband's trust is a fate worse than death? Is this a strategy Hermione is trying to use to defend herself, or was it expected in the time that a woman's pride and joy was found in a man?","To me can life be no commodity.
  The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,
  I do give lost, for I do feel it gone",Act 3 Scene 2,Gender
"As soon as the situation leaves his control, Leontes sees reason and wishes to undo his actions.",I have too much believed mine own suspicion.,Act 3 Scene 2,Class
"Shakespeare uses the word bug here, which we often use to describe something that is odd within the play that may mean something else. In this case the word means a horrible object according to the footnotes of the text. But it is an interesting bug, as Hermione seems to have suddenly lost the will to fight, most likely because the few people she has cared for are either dead/will be dead or have turned against her.",bug,Act 3 Scene 2,Class
"Why did Leontes send for the Oracle's word if he was only going to believe it if it favored his thinking? It seems as if he was going to turn the trial towards his side no matter what, truly becoming the tyrant. I think this really characterizes him and sets up his future potential for a character arc or redemption.",There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle.,Act 3 Scene 2,Class
"The Prince died because of fear not sorrow for the Queen's  future. One would think that he had died of sadness not of fear, but it loops back to the story he told, the winter's tale. He said that a scary tale was better for the winter than a  merry one, which the play itself then turns into that scary tale with Leontes entering.",fear,Act 3 Scene 2,Class
"This seems like such a shift in Paulina. She took such a ""masculine"" role with her bluntness in scolding Leontes, but she suddenly backs down and repents for that. It's interesting. Perhaps this was out of pity in seeing how Leontes realized his mistakes, but at the same time, it seems semi out of her character to become gentle towards a man who almost is irredeemable. ","I have showed too much
[245]  The rashness of a woman.",Act 3 Scene 2,Gender
Needle's,bodkin’s,Act 3 Scene 3,None
Maybe I've seen too many courtroom shows but it seems like this is an extremely skewed court because not only is Hermione already set up for failure and deemed untrustworthy but Leontes is also interrupting more than I thought should happen in a formal court.,You will not own it.,Act 3 Scene 2,None

Leontes added a new charge against Hermione: he now thinks she also conspired to murder him. His jealousy and inability to see the truth has only gotten worse.,"conspiring with Camillo
  to take away the life of our sovereign lord the Kin",Act 3 Scene 2,None
"The weather is the opposite of what I would imagine the seacoast to be like. I would think it would be bright and sunny, yet the approaching storm makes it seem like somewhere no one would want to be.","The skies look grimly

Leontes is delusional and no one seems to understand him. These references to dreams bring in a magical element as well.,"You speak a language that I understand not.

  Which I’ll lay down.",Act 3 Scene 2,None
"By saying this, is Leontes accidentally confirming that his suspicions are false?",Your actions are my dreams.,Act 3 Scene 2,Class
Hermione is barred from seeing Mamillius. Direct comparison to self isolation in a pandemic,"My second joy
  And first fruits of my body, from his presence
[105]  I am barred like one infectious",Act 3 Scene 2,Pandemics
In 3.2.136-137 Leontes ignored the prophecy of Apollo's oracle. Apollo is the Greek god of the Sun. The day growing dim represents Apollo's anger at having his prophecy disregarded; it is an omen of the events soon to occur.,"I never saw
  The heavens so dim by day.",Act 3 Scene 3,None
"Immediately, the prophecy is shown to be true. Leontes can not have an heir until his daughter is found","The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
  Of the Queen’s speed, is gone.",Act 3 Scene 2,Religion
"This is a testament to Antigonus' nobility and remorse; even though Leontes had simply ordered him to desert the child somewhere, Antigonus added a box of gold in the hopes someone would find the child and care for it with the money made off the gold.","Gold, all gold",Act 3 Scene 3,None
"This whole time, Leontes has banked on the oracle confirming his suspicions. Now that it hasn't, he is basically throwing all logic to the wind so as to not admit he's wrong. At this point, I can't believe that anyone would still believe (or if not believe, even follow) what he's saying.",There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle,Act 3 Scene 2,Class

Why does everyone keep dying?!,"how the poor gentleman roared

This is a really interesting line because she is saying that no matter what she will not be believed by the court because they already don't believe her. It is very similar to a witch test where there is no winning for the accused.,"Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
  Be so received",Act 3 Scene 2,Class
This is interesting because now Shakespeare is bringing ghosts and spirits into the magical part of the play.,"thy mother

"Reminds me of the physical separation of isolation during the current pandemic.  Especially at the beginning, even those who weren't sick were told to remain separated from others, almost like a ""just-in-case"" scenario.",I am barred like one infectious.,Act 3 Scene 2,Pandemics

  To these sorrows.",Act 3 Scene 2,None
Reminds me of winter weather.,The skies look grimly,Act 3 Scene 3,None
I feel like this highlights how crazy and jealous Leontes is. These people would literally do anything to prove Hermoine's innocence because of how sure they are.,"If th’ event o’ th’ journey
[15]  Prove as successful to the Queen—O, be ’t so!—",Act 3 Scene 1,None
"Leontes definitely doesn't know this for sure, as earlier in the play he even mentions that he thinks it's Camillo that betrayed him and warned Polixenes, not Hermione. I feel like at this point, he's saying anything to convince the people, and in the process convincing himself of his lies.","Hermione, contrary to
[20]  the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel

"Hermoine is really appealing to the audience's emotions to convince everyone she is innocent, not that she has to convince anyone. I think also she is almost giving up at the end, like she knows her fate. ","But what your jealousies awake, I tell you

"Hermione was crying, which is out of character based on what we have seen so far. She tended to be more rational and keep her expressions of emotion limited for political reasons.","her eyes

"A physical and self-destructive manifestation of grief. Almost like she is daring Leontes to make it happen. Goes along with the earlier comments about a closely held, hot grief being a masculine expression of emotion.","What wheels, racks, fires? What flaying? Boiling

Would this make Hermione something like an immigrant? This would add a layer as to why she is so baselessly distrusted and accused.,The Emperor of Russia was my father.,Act 3 Scene 2,None
A strong logical defense after a strong appeal to sympathy.,"But what your jealousies awake, I tell you

Pathetic fallacy. Could be linked back to Roman Gods (Apollo or even Neptune.),"I would you did but see how it chafes,
  how it rages, how it takes up the shore. But that’s
[95]  not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor

  were warmer that got this than the poor thing is
  here. I’ll take it up for pity.",Act 3 Scene 3,
"Here Paulina apologizes for her ""rash"" behavior. Considering all that happened, and all that was said I don't see it as irrational. But we see her self control and ability to repent, in contrast with Leontes who defends his own suspicions until he realizes he has lost everyone. Do you think it is because she is conforming to social codes of conduct as a woman and queen, or is it her own empathy and social intelligence shining through?","I am sorry for ’t.
  All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,

  I do repent. Alas, I have showed too much

"Here we see that Hermione is bringing up her social status - she is the daughter of an Emperor. As an audience we see her being reduced to a women who is publicly shamed and humiliated. Unable to fight against the chain of injustice that has been triggered by Leontes' jealousy as a man in power. Here we see, she does not state her own opinion. The only way she feels she can validate what is happening to her is through the eyes of a man with similar power, her father. As modern women, we are more than just our fathers, husbands and sons. But to a woman of the time they were all she had. She lost her children and her husband, so her last resort was to validate her state through the pity and empathy she could only imagine receiving from her father while fighting abuse and false allegations from Leontes.

Leonetes's  jealousy  has now taken the form of paranoia. He is imagining rumors regarding his married life when in fact  he is not even sure about it as of yet.  This paranoia could be seen in this time of the pandemic when people who were misinformed would take actions based on it. For instance the drop in the supply of toilet papers and groceries in the initial days of the lockdown.,"They’re here with me already, whisp’ring,

"The sensory imagery of the word ""sear"" turns this relationship between calumny and virtue into something physical and it implies that virtue is something that can be burned, and therefore maimed. Is it possible, therefore, that it can be healed?  Is virtue really reliant on something external such as reputation?","for calumny will sear
  Virtue itself",Act 2 Scene 1,Gender
B) it seems to me that a lot of importance is given to words here. Mainly how Hermione was able to make  Polixenes stay by just using her words.,Our praises are our wages,Act 1 Scene 2,
A) I think it quite unflattering the way Hermione is suggesting that women live for praises by their husbands. almost as if it is their husbands words which gives them validation.,Our praises are our wages.,Act 1 Scene 2,
"Hermione has used the term ""sin"" when referring to physical relations, especially when made with someone outside of wedlock. I find it ironic that later in the play she herself would be accused of this ""sin"".","If you first sinned with us, and that with us
  You did continue fault, and that you slipped not
  With any but with us.",Act 1 Scene 2,
"Polixenes and Hermione's conversation has taken the form of  light flirting here. They are both very  involved in the conversation and it seems to suggest that they have previously indulged in such light banter, seeing how at ease they are. Even though Polixenes and Leonetes were childhood friends, Hermione has more convincing arguments to make him stay. It causes one to doubt whether Leonetes's jealousy actually had some basis.","Your guest, then, madam.
  To be your prisoner should import offending,
  Which is for me less easy to commit
  Than you to punish.",Act 1 Scene 2,
The phrasing of this line makes it seem that the prince is all that is holding the Kingdom together. It makes me wonder whether they will have the same reaction if there was a princess.,"ARCHIDAMUS  If the King had no son, they would desire
  to live on crutches till he had one.",Act 1 Scene 1,
For me this was the obvious shift from Sicilia to Bohemia. This may be too literal of a choice but this jumped out at me right away.,"Thou art perfect, then, our ship hath touched upon

Homosexual undertones between male characters could be seen in almost all works of Shakespeare.,"Were in your love a whip to me,",Act 1 Scene 2,
"Sexism, the excessive importance of a male heir in any kingdom.","If the King had no son, they would desire

"I thought it was really interesting how she seems to be the pinnacle of womanhood to these men. She is desirable as two men are fighting over her, or at least Leontes is fighting over her. But even to the other lord of scicilia she is the example because if she cheats then who's to say if other wives haven't? It also ties into the class/status conversation too.

Saying that God and the heavens above know that she is not guilty. She is being painted as a liar and knows that Leontes doesn't want to hear anything she has to say.

"I think it's interesting that Shakespeare opens this scene with a mother rejecting her child. This is quite a taboo concept in human society, even though it happens often in nature. There are many explanations for this, and I think it's normal for mothers (especially because she's heavily pregnant) to want time away from their children. The difference between Leontes and Hermione is that Hermione's rejection is temporary, but Leontes' is final and irreversible ","Take the boy to you. He so troubles me

"This idea of being wild VS civilized is a common theme found in fairy tales and folklore. From the story of Oedipus to Daphnis and Chloe to the Tempest literature loves to play with the idea of a lost child of royal descent being accidently raised in the wild, only to be restored to their rightful position because it's somehow ordained to be their birthright. But it's actually Leontes wild, or rash behavior that sets off this whole thing. He's the uncivilized one here, not his child. ","Yet, for a greater confirmation—

I thought that this was a very dramatic sentiment.  Antigonus is trying to appeal to Leontes and show his loyalty by condemning all women for Hermione's alleged infidelity.  Do you think this was a justifiable action/will it work to appeal to Leontes?,"I have three daughters—the eldest is eleven;

"Hermione continues to say that she is innocent and wrongly accused yet she does not really put up a fight against Leontes' wishes here, which could mean death if Leontes becomes paranoid enough.

"Paulina has a mind of her own and actively  works against Leontes' accusations to defend Hermione.  In a sense, she takes the associated masculine position of that time where even her own husband cannot prevent her from speaking out loud. I think this is one of the times where Shakespeare flips gender roles around similar to Lady Macbeth in Macbeth. The interesting thing is that Paulina, a woman, is more outspoken than all of the king's men, which is rare during these times, but also characterizes her as a good person and ultimately more likeable by the reader.","I told her so, my lord,
  On your displeasure’s peril and on mine,",Act 2 Scene 3,Gender
"Leontes feels threatened by Paulina and her very dominant position in this argument, which automatically causes him to call her a witch. This is one of those knee jerk reactions from Leontes, to accuse someone of witchcraft because they are different or more radical. Paulina is actually standing up for Hermione, but it is considered bad because a) she is a woman b) she is arguing with the king and c) Leontes is paranoid and perhaps a bit insane at the moment.",A mankind witch!,Act 2 Scene 3,Gender
Leontes tries to remove the blame and guilt he may feel because of wrongly accusing his own wife by insulting Paulina. It is in a sense just paining all wives as terrible burdens to take off his own burden and conscience from getting the best of him.,He dreads his wife.,Act 2 Scene 3,Class
"Leontes makes the child out to be a thing, even a burden. His negative diction in ""brat"" and ""it"" towards the baby objectifies it, causing it to sound less like a human being and more of a mistake or worthless thing. He does it so that he himself does not feel the weight of putting an innocent child in harms way by leaving it up to fate whether or not the child will live or not.",brat’s,Act 2 Scene 3,Class

It is interesting to note that Polixenes is not persuaded by his childhood friend Leontes but by Leontes' wife Hermione. Polixenes and Hermione seem to have a frank relationship which probably incites Leontes' jealousy.,"Your guest, then, madam.",Act 1 Scene 2,Class
It is very ironical that first Leontes lets his imagination go wild and accuses his wife of adultery. And then goes on to say that he wouldn't taint her honour.,"I’ll give no blemish to her honor, none.",Act 1 Scene 2,None
It is appalling how the Duke of Burgundy would step back from his proposal just because he wouldn't receive a dowry.  He comes across as such a gold digger.,"I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father

"This is the first time I'm noticing a comparison drawn of women and creatures. Earlier, Leontes discusses with Mamillius that being a man/cuckold will give you horns; there have been numerous times the men have been depicted as horned animals. Somewhere in Act 1, Hermione refers to the devil in the context of the women in the play, which is fascinating given that the men are the ones with horns. Here, it seems so much more belittling to think of the women as untamable beasts in a stable. the last few lines set up a good perspective of what a woman should've been like in those times: docile and pet-like","If it prove

"This reminded me of the phrase ""listeners never hear good of themselves"" - in this case, Leontes has gone searching for plots against him and found evidence that he uses to support his preconceived suspicions.

"I find this passage interesting. It gives a reference to ancient Greece, and specifically Apollo and his association to oracles, such as Delphine. Why does Leontes leave everything up to fate and divine intervention? Also, there seems to be multiple references to Greco-Roman mythology as seen also when Leontes says to abandon the child and one of his men hoped that some wolf or animal would take care of her like Romulus and Remus.","I have dispatched in post

" According to the footnote, ""The instruments that feel"" refer to fingers or hands that physically feel things. I find it interesting how Leontes refers to the physical sensation of feeling, especially when you consider the fact that his accusations against Hermione go purely on a gut feeling.  What are your thoughts on this? Have any other passages relating to a character's feelings stood out to you? It's also worthy to note that ""cold"" and ""dead"" invoke wintry imagery that ties into the title of the play.

"I found this line interesting because I couldn't quite decide how best to interpret it. I think you could interpret the line in one of two ways: that if Hermione was lying, Antigonus would treat his wife's quarters the way he treats his stables, treating her no better than a horse, or that he would lock up his wife in his stables so he knew where she was at all times. Which interpretation do you think is the strongest? Do you see any other ways the lines could be interpreted? Do you think the language is ambiguous on purpose?

"This is a paragraph that interests me and I would like to look at as a group. In our discussion in class we talked about reality VS illusion as something that divides Hermione & Polixenes from Leontes. Leontes is unable to enter their conversation because they talk about things with ""certainty"", and things they ""verily"" believe in. Again this also brings up the question of what really is going on between Hermione and Polixenes. Here they seem to be evenly matched on an intellectual level, with Hermoining asserting that ""A lady...is as potent as a lord's"". She sees them as equals. Potent also suggests fertility. Also note the previous mention of Polixenes trying to ""unsphere the stars with oaths"", does that suggest some kind of previous understanding between them? Whatever is going on, it's certainty ""nothing"" Leontes has ever seen before. ","Verily,
  You shall not go. A lady’s “verily” is
[65]  As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?
  Force me to keep you as a prisoner,

"Leontes' jealousy and irrational thoughts are looked at by others as a disease or illness that has affected him. In this case, it's not Leontes' fault that he feels this way, someone else caused this. Earlier, in Act 1, Camillo tells Leontes to ""be cured/Of this diseased opinion."" What is the effect of posing Leontes' jealousy as an illness, as something out of his control?  Do you think that Leontes is truly sick (in the head), or is he simply prejudiced and irrational?","It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.

"Again, we see the strong will of Paulina and Antigonus's inability to stop her. Leontes points out that Antigonus is ""dethroned"" from his role of authority by his wife, who will not let him stop her.","Thou dotard; thou art woman-tired, unroosted",Act 2 Scene 3,
